# AniZen Project Tracker

## Instructions
1.  **Read Plan First**: Before starting any major task, read `PLAN.md` in the project root to understand the current objectives and context.
2.  **Update Plan**: When a task is completed, update `PLAN.md` by marking the checkbox as `[x]`. If a new task arises, add it to the list.
3.  **Track Changes**: For significant code changes, append a brief entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (create it if it doesn't exist).

## Resources
- This skill assumes `PLAN.md` exists in the workspace root.
